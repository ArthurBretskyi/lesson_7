              The Samsung Galaxy S5 was announced on 24 February 2014. It
              improves upon the Galaxy S4 by adding a heart rate monitor,[38]
              IP67 water resistance,[39] a fingerprint scanner,[40] the ability
              to record 4K videos (2160p at 30fps) and 1080p at twice the frame
              rate (60 fps),[41] phase-detection autofocus which is faster than
              previously used contrast detection, the ability to take better
              photos in low light levels,[42] a "Download Booster" feature to
              increase download levels to the maximum bandwidth allowed,[43] the
              ability to restrict the usage of battery by limiting the phone's
              usage,[44] and USB 3.0.[45] It lacks the thermometer (temperature)
              sensor, hygrometer (humidity) sensor, and "Story Album" features
              from the preceding Galaxy S4, but largely inherited Air View and
              gesture-related functionality. "Quick glance" was replaced with
              "Air wake-up", which allows waking up the smartphone from stand-by
              mode by hovering over the proximity sensor.
            </p>
            <p class="galaxy-sfive-text">
              The Galaxy S5 is the first Samsung mobile phone where the touch
              key on the left side of the home button is a task key instead of
              an option key, and the last mobile phone in the Galaxy S series to
              be equipped with a user-replaceable battery. The Galaxy S5 is the
              last mobile phone in the Galaxy S series with a micro-SIM card;
              later phones use a nano-SIM card.
            </p>
            <p class="galaxy-sfive-text">
              Since the Galaxy S5, the model number (e.g. SM-G900F) is no longer
              displayed on the boot screen.

              Vikings[a] is the modern name given to seafaring people originally
              from Scandinavia (present-day Denmark, Norway and
              Sweden),[3][4][5][6] who from the late 8th to the late 11th
              centuries raided, pirated, traded and settled throughout parts of
              Europe.[7][8][9] They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean,
              North Africa, Volga Bulgaria, the Middle East, and North America.
              In some of the countries they raided and settled in, this period
              is popularly known as the Viking Age, and the term "Viking" also
              commonly includes the inhabitants of the Scandinavian homelands as
              a collective whole. The Vikings had a profound impact on the early
              medieval history of Scandinavia, the British Isles, France,
              Estonia, and Kievan Rus'.

            <p class="galaxy-s-third-text">
              Expert sailors and navigators aboard their characteristic
              longships, Vikings established Norse settlements and governments
              in the British Isles, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland,
              Normandy, and the Baltic coast, as well as along the Dnieper and
              Volga trade routes across modern-day Russia, Belarus,[11] and
              Ukraine,[12] where they were also known as Varangians. The
              Normans, Norse-Gaels, Rus' people, Faroese and Icelanders emerged
              from these Norse colonies. The Vikings also voyaged to
              Constantinople, Iran,[13] and Arabia.[14] They were the first
              Europeans to reach North America, briefly settling in Newfoundland
              (Vinland). While spreading Norse culture to foreign lands, they
              simultaneously brought home slaves, concubines and foreign
              cultural influences to Scandinavia, influencing the genetic[15]
              and historical development of both. During the Viking Age, the
              Norse homelands were gradually consolidated from smaller kingdoms
              into three larger kingdoms: Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
